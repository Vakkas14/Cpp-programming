| `*`      | Multiplication      | a * b   |
| `/`      | Division            | a / b   |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | a % b   |
| `++`     | Increment           | a++     |
| `--`     | Decrement           | a--     |

Relational (Comparison) Operators

| `!=`     | Not equal to          | a != b  |
| `>`      | Greater than          | a > b   |
| `<`      | Less than             | a < b   |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | a >= b  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | a <= b  |

Logical Operators
| Operator | Meaning     | Example |            |   |   |   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- | - | - | - |
| `&&`     | Logical AND | a && b  |            |   |   |   |
| `        |             | `       | Logical OR | a |   | b |
| `!`      | Logical NOT | !a      |            |   |   |   |

Assignment Operators
| Operator | Meaning             | Example |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| `=`      | Assign value        | a = 5   |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      | a += 5  |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | a -= 5  |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | a *= 5  |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   | a /= 5  |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign  | a %= 5  |

Bitwise Operators
| Operator | Meaning     | Example    |   |   |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- | - | - |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND | a & b      |   |   |
| `        | `           | Bitwise OR | a | b |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR | a ^ b      |   |   |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT | ~a         |   |   |
| `<<`     | Left shift  | a << 1     |   |   |
| `>>`     | Right shift | a >> 1     |   |   |

| `?:`     | Ternary (conditional) operator |
| `sizeof` | Returns size of variable       |
| `&`      | Address-of operator            |
| `*`      | Pointer dereference            |
| `->`     | Access member via pointer      |
| `.`      | Access class/struct member     |
| `::`     | Scope resolution               |
| `new`    | Allocate memory                |
| `delete` | Deallocate memory              |
| `typeid` | Get type information           |
