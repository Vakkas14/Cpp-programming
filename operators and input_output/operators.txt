1.Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Meaning             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition            |
| `-`      | Subtraction         |
| `*`      | Multiplication      |
| `/`      | Division            |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) |

Important Notes:
Division between integers removes decimals.
% works only with integers.

2.Relational (Comparison) Operators
| Operator | Meaning               |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to              |
| `!=`     | Not equal             |
| `>`      | Greater than          |
| `<`      | Less than             |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    |
Note
Used mainly in:
if statements
loops
conditions

3.Logical Operators
| Operator | Meaning                 |   |                        |
| -------- | ----------------------- | - | ---------------------- |
| `&&`     | AND (both must be true) |   |                        |
| `||`     |                         | ` | OR (at least one true) |
| `!`      | NOT (reverse condition) |   |                        |

4.Bitwise Operators
| Operator | Meaning     |    |
| -------- | ----------- | -- |
| `&`      | AND         |    |
| `|`      | OR          |    |
| `^`      | XOR         |    |
| `~`      | NOT         |    |
| `<<`     | Left shift  |    |
| `>>`     | Right shift |    |

Binary AND, &, Copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands
Binary OR, |, Copies a bit to the result if it exists in any of the operands
Binary XOR, ^, Copies the bit to the result if it is present in either of the operands but not both
Left Shift, <<, Shifts the value to the left by the number of bits specified by the right operand
Right Shift, >>, Shifts the value to the right by the number of bits specified by the right operand
One's Complement, ~, Changes binary digits 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
Used in:
Low-level programming
Embedded systems
Performance optimization

5. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign value to a variable. We assign the value of right operand into left operand according to which assignment operator we use.

Assignment, =, Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left
Add and Assignment, +=, Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
Subtract and Assignment, -=, Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
Multiply and Assignment, *=, Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand
Divide and Assignment, /=, Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand

6. Ternary or Conditional Operators
Conditional operator returns the value, based on the condition. This operator takes three operands, therefore it is known as a Ternary Operator.
Syntax:
Expression1 ? Expression2 : Expression3

In the above statement:
The ternary operator ? determines the answer on the basis of the evaluation of Expression1.
If Expression1 is true, then Expression2 gets evaluated.
If Expression1 is false, then Expression3 gets evaluated.

Member & Pointer Operators (Miscellaneous Operators)
| Operator | Use                        |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| `.`      | Access object members      |
| `->`     | Access members via pointer |
| `&`      | Address of variable        |
| `*`      | Pointer dereference        |

1. sizeof Operator
sizeof operator is a unary operator used to compute the size of its operand or variable in bytes. For example,
sizeof (char);
sizeof (var_name);

2. Comma Operator (,)
Comma operator is a binary operator that is used for multiple purposes. It is used as a separator or used to evaluate its first operand and discards the result; it then evaluates the second operand and returns this value (and type).
int n = (m+1, m-2, m+5);
int a, b, c;

3. Addressof Operator (&)
Addressof operator is used to find the memory address in which a particular variable is stored. In C++, it is also used to create a reference.
&var_name;

4. Dot Operator(.)
Dot operator is used to access members of structure variables or class objects using their object names.
obj . member;

5. Arrow Operator
Arrow operator is used to access the variables of classes or structures through its pointer.
sptr -> member;

6. Casting Operators
Casting operators are used to convert the value of one data type to another data type. For example, for an integer value x:
(float)x
static_cast<float>(x)










Other Useful perators
& → Address-of
* → Pointer dereference
new → Allocate memory
delete → Free memory
, → Comma operator
typeid → Get type info
