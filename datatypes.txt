what is data types?
    A data type tells the computer:
    “What kind of data is this?” and “How much memory should be used?”
    In simple words:
        Data type = type of value a variable can store
    over-all ---> Data types specify the type of data that a variable can store

Why Data Types Are Important in DSA?
    Because:
    They decide memory usage
    They prevent overflow errors
    They affect performance
    They define operations allowed on data
    Example:
    You cannot divide a string
    You cannot store decimals in int

Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared.

data types in C++           drived data types           user define data types        
Basic data types            array                       class
int                         pointer                     structure
float                       reference                   union
doubble                     function                    typedef
char                                                    using

| `unsigned char`  | 1 byte               | 0 to 255                        |
| `short`          | 2 bytes              | -32,768 to 32,767               |
| `unsigned short` | 2 bytes              | 0 to 65,535                     |
| `int`            | 4 bytes              | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| `unsigned int`   | 4 bytes              | 0 to 4,294,967,295              |
| `long`           | 4 or 8 bytes         | Depends on system               |
| `unsigned long`  | 4 or 8 bytes         | Depends on system               |
| `long long`      | 8 bytes              | Very large integers             |
| `float`          | 4 bytes              | ~6–7 decimal digits precision   |
| `double`         | 8 bytes              | ~15 decimal digits precision    |
| `long double`    | 8, 12, or 16 bytes   | Very high precision             |
